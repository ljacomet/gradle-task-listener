This is a Gradle sample repository that shows how to replace some usages of `BuildListener.buildFinished` with a `BuildService`.
It allows a build to be configuration cache compatible as the first method is not supported in that context.

See {url-repo-file}/build-logic/src/main/kotlin/org.test.task-listener.gradle.kts[precompiled script plugin] for details.
